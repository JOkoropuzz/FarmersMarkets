# _WEBapp about farmers markets based on pgsql database_

## Functional
The database contains information about 1514 farmers' markets. The application allows you to sort markets by state and city, as well as search by zip code, city and state. Each farmer's market has a page with detailed information, among which you can find longitude, latitude and a list of product categories.


## Creating pgsql database
The source file containing information about farmers markets is __Export.csv__ in csv folder. Other csv files in this folder are prepared to populate the database. To create a database, just run the script __DB_create_script__
